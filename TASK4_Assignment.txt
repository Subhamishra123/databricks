Analyzing Employee Performance

Consider two tables, employees and performance_logs, 
which store information about employees and their performance records, 
respectively.

Table 1: employees

+---+-------+--------+
| id|  name| role |
+---+-------+--------+
| 1| Arun|Developer|
| 2|  Bharath | Manager|
| 3|Thulasi|Developer|
| 4| David| Manager|
+---+-------+---------+

Table 2: performance_logs

+--------+-------+-----------+
|log_date |emp_id |performance|
+--------+-------+-----------+
|2023-01-01|   1 |    8.5|
|2023-01-01|   2 |    7.2|
|2023-01-01|   3 |    9.0|
|2023-01-02|   1 |    8.0|
|2023-01-02|   2 |    7.5|
|2023-01-02|   3 |    8.8|
+--------+-------+-----------+

1) Write a pyspark code to find the count of employees for each role.

2) Calculate the average performance of each employee across all dates.

3) dentify the top-performing employee for each role based on the maximum performance score. 
In case of ties, prioritize the smaller employee ID.

4) Determine the role with the highest average performance across all employees.
